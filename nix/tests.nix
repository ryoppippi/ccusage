# Rust workspace test run as a Nix derivation so it shares the crane
# `cargoArtifacts` cache (warm on the per-job Blacksmith sticky disk) instead of
# recompiling into an uncached `rust/target` on every CI run. Built by the CI
# test job via `nix build .#ccusage-tests`; the derivation succeeds only when
# `cargo test --workspace` passes.
