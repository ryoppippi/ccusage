# Task runner — the single entry point for development and release.
#
# Each workspace package has its own justfile, imported below as a module; root
# recipes aggregate them (e.g. `typecheck` runs every package's typecheck).
# Whole-repo jobs that the Nix flake owns (formatting, checks, schema) stay here.
#
# pnpm policy: repo-global tools and pinned package tools provided by the Nix
# dev shell are called directly; package-scoped tools that are not in Nix still
# go through pnpm. `build` is delegated with `pnpm run` because npm prepack
# invokes that script by name.
#
# Run `just --list` (or `just <module>::--list`) to see everything.
